The contents of this folder are to ensure a correct configure of the 
RPI controller running within each laser rifle and anchor. Two scripts 
are included: 

	tag_config.sh
	anchor_config.sh

These scripts should be ran to copy the contents of this folder into 
the necessary locations on the host device. These changes will affect
specifically how the device boots.

On the 'tag' host, the device should boot into the correct web-page 
with valid window size, resolution, and screen refresh settings. The 
main controller program should also be launched with the correct tag 
info being passed in. Upon running the tag_config.sh script, the user 
will be prompted with the tag ID number of the host device. This will
then set the correct ID in the necessary locations for valid operation.

On the 'anchor' host, the device should boot to console only with the 
main controller program running in the background. Similar to the 
script ran for the 'tag' host, the user will be prompted for the ID of
the anchor upon running the anchor_config.sh script.
