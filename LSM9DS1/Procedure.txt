Startup procedure:

imu.init()
    - basically defines a bunch of constants used for masking into registers
    for read and writes, (ex: scale and speed)
    - initializes wiringpisetup()

imu.begin()
    - constrainScales() - constrain scale values to something defined? Dumb function
    - calcRes(): calculate resolution for accel gyro and mag - basically pulling
        from header file #defines and storing in new global variables
    - Verify connection: read ID bytes from mag and xg devices
    initGyro():
    initAccel():
    initMag():

imu.calibrate()
