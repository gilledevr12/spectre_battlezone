Startup procedure:

imu.init()
    - basically defines a bunch of constants used for masking into registers
    for read and writes, (ex: scale and speed)
    - initializes wiringpisetup()

imu.begin()
    - constrainScales() - constrain scale values to something defined? Dumb function
    - calcRes(): calculate resolution for accel gyro and mag - basically pulling
        from header file #defines and storing in new global variables
    - Verify connection: read ID bytes from mag and xg devices
    initGyro():
    initAccel():
    initMag():

imu.calibrate()

i2c_write_byte()
    writes for both xg and mag (0x6b and 0x1e)
    fd=wiringpisetup using(device address)
        calls setup_i2c_device():
            fd = open("/dev/i2c-1", O_RDWR);
            ioctl(fd, I2C_SLAVE, device address)
    wiringpiwritereg8(fd, register address, data to be written))
        
    close(fd)
