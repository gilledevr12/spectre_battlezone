int (file_descriptor) socket(socket_address, socket_type, protocol_type)
    socket_address - client or server address being instantiated
    socket_type - stream or datagram (SOCK_STREAM vs SOCK_DGRAM)
    protocol_type - leave field at 0 to let OS decide

    file_descriptor - used for all subsequent calls to socket

bind(socket_file_descriptor, (struct sockaddr *) &new_addr, sizeof(new_addr))
    used to bind the server socket to a port_number
    cast the sockaddr_in to sockaddr

listen(socket_file_descriptor, 5)
    allows the process to listen on the socket for connections.
    the integer 5 represents the number of connections that can be waiting while the process
        is handling a particular connection
